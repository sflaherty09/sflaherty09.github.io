Hi, my name is Sean Flaherty and I am a Senior at Ramapo College of New Jersey studying Computer Science. I made this website to compile all the work I have done into one place. Here you will find websites or pieces of software I have worked on through school or websites I helped to design through my tenure at Tranquility49 PR. I am interested in the Web Development field and am working towards one day being a Full Stack Engineer.
